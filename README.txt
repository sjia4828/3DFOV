If you use this technique for research purpose, please cite this journal paper 'Jiang, S., et al., Three-dimensional fabric orientation visualisation technique for distributed fracture using X-ray computed tomography. International Journal of Rock Mechanics and Mining Sciences, 2020.' please.

Three-dimensional fabric orientation visualisation technique is designed for fabric orientation characterisation and visualisation. This technique is applicable to any 3D dataset, such as CT, PET or MRI. It is possible to use the technique to visualise various fabric measures related to heterogeneous structures in different materials, such cracks, bones and fibres.

This technique includes two seperate Matlab code file, namely, 3DFOV.m and 3DV.m. 3DFOV.m is used for the characterisation and the 3DV.m is used for the 3D visilisation of the results. An example with relevant image files are also provided.
